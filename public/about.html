    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, I am a 26 year old female who decided to learn web developmemt and computer science because I wanted my career to shift.</p>

    <p>I have many hobbies which include: reading, writing, working out, and baking. I am very introverted but can turn extroverted at social events. Sometimes I don't feel like going somewhere, but then I don't want to leave.</p>

    <p>My two favorite music artsts are 5SOS and BTS. They are both really good and have done extraordinary work.</p>
